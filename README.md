# Data Structures & Algorithms

This project is a TypeScript library built to reinforce core computer science foundations through hands-on programming.

---

### Key Features

* **Graph Theory:**
    * **Data Structures:** Graph (adjacency list/matrix), Heap, Linked List, Queue.
    * **Algorithms:** DFS, BFS, Components, Topology Ordering, Articulation Points, Bridges, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Ford-Fulkerson, etc.

---

### Goal

This project serves as a personal learning and reference resource, developed to:

* Solidify core concepts through a code-first implementation.
* Ensure correctness by writing comprehensive unit tests with Jest.
* Provide a platform for exploring more advanced algorithms and data structures in the future.
